# Description

Build a logger for my needs  

_I'm on a mission that people say is impossible_  
_But when I swing my swords they all choppable_  
_I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper_  
_Child educator, plus head amputator_

# TODO

- Write a readme
- Add option for timestamp
- Add precommit hook, so `yarn build` is started and npm publish uses new build
- Think about mode structure
